## What Is It

An extensible, __by design__, natural language processing library and detection framework for **node.js**.

## Motivation

There are more than few NLP projects out there, however when your project is built with Node.js and the NLP you're using is written in another language (python is common choice), this introduces an unnecessary level of complexity and more experience requirements for your team.

JavaScript and Node.js is rising in the bots world, where natural language processing is a core requirement, yet the best natural language processing projects are written in other languages.

This project, by no means, should be considered as an alternative to the established state of the art current solutions, but it tries to provide you with a handy features and tools that might cover your needs.
